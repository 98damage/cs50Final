Beet is a webapp that simplifies and optimises meal planning and cooking.

Users are asked to fill out a survey which includes dietary information about themselves and the people they live with.

Beet retrieves this survey information from the users which then feeds into the OpenAI API, the user is presented with a range of options for their meals for the week that are suited to their requirements. The user can select out of a list of recipes what they
want to cook for the week. Beet then provides a calender system that lets the user plan when and how to cook their meals they selected for the week. A shopping list is also provided for these recipes.
